        Holding your pinky and just telling you how much I love you. All of it was just the best.

      <p class="event-paragraph">This day! I would argue that this was the most pivotal day in our relationship because of the comfort and love we felt after this.
        Just everything about it. My panic shopping and planning with Api. Trying to hype you up for the day without telling you what I was doing. Sharan helping me shop and 
        making sure you never saw the basket while I put it in your car. Me being pissed at sana for keeping you for an extra hour. Our first long day together. You being awkward with the
        cake singing. Me stressing over how I'd give you the basket without you seeing it first. Api keeping you company while I run to the car. MEETING AMMI FOR THE FIRST TIME. HUGGING YOU 
        PROPERLY for the first time. Sheru's birthday. Having your chai for the first time. Seeing you the happiest and most energetic I've ever seen you after my meeting with ammi. Just the best.

        Being too exhausted during my flight to even consider the possibility of messages not delivering. Your dumbass detective work which stressed me out as soon as I landed and I stressed
        api out too. Actually doing hella photoshop work to prove I'm not in dubai and just when I'm 5 minutes away, Bhabhi just calls to annoy me smh. Just catching up in that booth while you're 
        in pain because of your back and your ammi driving us around. It was just cute. Its only where I gave you the forever rose and Dumb (You) and Dumber (Me) necklace.

        I still regret not taking a picture there. Our dumbass sugar convo. Giving your ammi a thumbs up at the end just for her to slap my hand. Alhamdulillah worked out WAAAAYYYYYY better than either
